# grocery-restock
This is a mini-project I completed in the 2021-22 year. It utilizes the SQLite database, and it stores information on grocery items and tells the employee when to restock and what requires restocking. Heaps and Queues were used for this project, and rationale, documentation, and video testing can be found through the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzuW7wfRhdXDlQHMRRN2rdRFbijNly_c/edit
